infostreamer

 - make separate class for streamer(s)
 - Implementation through ibsimu: one stream with several different
   channels: debug(several) and verbose output
 - Solution: verbose is just one of the types.
 - set_output( stream )
 - inc_indent( type ), dec_indent( type )
 - set_verbose_level( type, level )
 - printing: 
   * verbose( level ) << stream
   * debug( type, level ) << stream

- Printing has a problem because a separate flush is needed. 
Go for printf style?

handle_trajectory() / build_coldata()

 - The method which is now used is very sensitive to rounding of
   particle location into a mesh. It might be possible that the
   build_coldata() disagrees with handle_trajectory() on where the
   particle is. This might cause serious problems. Have to redo! 
 - Proposal: build_coldata should make a database containing absolute
   mesh locations.
 - Also do the exception for particles entering the geometry as
   the first mesh intersection of the step.
 - Mesh coordinate for particle being calculated should be stored 
   during the calculation.

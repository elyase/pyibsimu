			RELEASING
			=========


This is a list of procedures to follow when making a release of IBSimu.

 - Update source tree: 'git pull origin master'
 - Edit version number in configure.in, Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am and 
   tests/Makefile.am. Add a new ibsimu-1.0.4.pc.in file
 - Run 'make check' to test library and visually inspect test images.
 - Write NEWS update for release
 - Run 'make clean', './reconf' and 'git2changelog.py'
 - Run 'make distcheck' to check for packaging errors and to produce
   the release tarball.
 - Commit changes: Run 'git commit -a' and
   'git push origin master'
 - Tag all files in cvs with version string with 'git tag release-1-0-4',
   where the release version number is the current version.
 - Push tags to server: 'git push --tags origin'
 - Edit version number in configure.in to '1.0.4dev' to indicate 
   after-release version of code.
